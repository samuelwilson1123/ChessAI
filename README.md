# Sam Chess

The goal of this project is to create an AI that plays you in chess using methods such as Alpha-beta pruning and bitboards. Currently
the program works as a two player chess game with pseudo legal moves.

NOTE: This project is still in early development, see Roadmap for current stage of progress


## Roadmap
 
 * [X]  Represent state of board in the form of bitboards
 * [X]  Generate pseudo legal moves
 * [X]  Allow user input
 * [ ]  [just started] Generate legal moves
 * [ ]  Implement evalutation function for a single board instance
 * [ ]  Implement Alpha-beta pruning to select best possible move at certain depth
 * [ ]  Connect the program to a UI
 



## Usage

If you would like to use this program use the following commands: 
```
make
./chess
```
Note that at the current stage of development the program is simply a 2 player implementation of chess. As development continues more options will be made available
